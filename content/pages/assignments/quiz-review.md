Study Questions
---------------

What does STS stand for?

STS has variously been described as an inter-, multi-, or even transdisciplinary field.

What was going on in the larger world that encouraged this emergence? (Downes)

What are some common core convictions shared by STS scholars? (Downes)

What are some key questions asked in STS studies?

What are some ways in which MIT as an institution polarized around science and engineering tries to influence the larger world?

What other questions do you have about STS that we should discuss further this term?
